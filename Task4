So that you can take a more detailed look at the lowest performing hotels, you want to get service and branch information where the average rating for the branch and service combination is lower than 4.5 - the target set by management.

Your output should be a DataFrame named 'average_rating'
It should return the service_id and branch_id, and the average rating (avg_rating)
Values should be rounded to 2 decimal places where appropriate.

SELECT 
    service_id,
    branch_id,
    ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM 
    request
GROUP BY 
    service_id, branch_id
HAVING 
    AVG(rating) < 4.5;
