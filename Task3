The management team want to target improvements in Meal and Laundry service in Europe (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM).

Write a query to return the description of the service, the id and location of the branch, the id of the request as request_id and the rating for the services and locations of interest to the management team.

Your output should be a DataFrame named 'target_hotels'.

Use the original branch table, not the output of task 1.

SELECT 
    s.description,
    b.id AS branch_id,
    b.location,
    r.id AS request_id,
    r.rating
FROM 
    request r
JOIN 
    service s ON r.service_id = s.id
JOIN 
    branch b ON r.branch_id = b.id
WHERE 
    (LOWER(s.description) LIKE '%meal%' OR LOWER(s.description) LIKE '%laundry%')
    AND b.location IN ('EMEA', 'LATAM');
