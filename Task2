The Head of Operations wants to know whether there is a difference in time taken to respond to a customer request in each hotel. They already know that different services take different lengths of time.

Calculate the average and maximum duration for each branch and service.

Your output should be a DataFrame named 'average_time_service'
It should include the columns service_id, branch_id, avg_time_taken and max_time_taken
Values should be rounded to two decimal places where appropriate.

SELECT 
    service_id,
    branch_id,
    ROUND(AVG(time_taken), 2) AS avg_time_taken,
    ROUND(MAX(time_taken), 2) AS max_time_taken
FROM 
    request
GROUP BY 
    service_id, branch_id;
